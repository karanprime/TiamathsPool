    "\n",
    "Chaotic processes are systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. A famous example of a chaotic process in the butterfly effect: a tornado in Georgia is the result of a butterfly flapping its wings in China. The only way to predict chaotic system is analytically. For systems of many variables, eg weather, chemical reactions etc, running an analytically calculating the state of the system at each time step would require a prohibitive amount of computation. In this project, I use a technique called Reservoir Computing with a reservoir being a class of Recurrent Neural Networks called Echo State Networks to predict the two chaotic systems: Mackey-Glass, consiting of only one time-varying variable and Chua's Circuit, consisting of three time varying variables. While my learner is effective at learning Mackey-Glass, predicting Chua's circuit works well only for short amounts of time."

    "A chaotic system is one in which infinitesimal differences in the starting conditions lead to drastically different results as the system evolves. This makes it impossible to predict the state of the system at a time point in the non-immediate future.\n",
    "A double pendulum is an example of a chaotic system, consisting of a pendulum attached to the bob of another pendulum. It is characterized by two parameters: $ \\theta_1$ and $ \\theta_2$, which are the initial positions of the two bobs. The following simulation[1] shows how a small variation in the initial position leads to a wide difference in the motion of the pendulums:\n",

    "Reservoir Computing (RC) is a machine learning algorithm using a *reservoir* and an output learner. The reservoid itself is a random but fixed recurrent neural network(RNN). Here, random but fixed means that the edges and weight of the RNN are initialized randomly and kept fixed for training and testing. The output learner is a linear transformation of the reservoir output. Any learning algorithm can be used as an output learner, from simple linear rigression to convolutional neural networks. The following diagram shows the general structure of an RC learner, where $U$ is the input and $Y$ is the prediction:\n",

    "Reservoir computing benefits from relatively lower training costs, as compared to traditional RNNs and LSTMs, because of the actual weights of the reservoir RNN are initialized randomly and then kept fixed. Only the output learner is trained. They have been shown to successfully predict chaotic systems for non-intermediate times [3, 4, 5] for simple cases. In this project, I  reproduce the often studied Mackey-Glass system and apply RC to Chua's Circuit for the first time.\n"
